# Comic-Shader-Pack
This pack of shaders was built for Sinespace during our four part tutorial series covering nonphotorealistic rendering in Unity.

This project only contains the shaders, the models themselves are available on the Unity Asset Store.

If you want to watch this being built; you can follow along in the 4 (roughly 1 hour each) video tutorials - part of our regular masterclass series.
